# Data-Wrangling-and-Analyzing
Real-world data rarely comes clean. I have used Python and its libraries, I have gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. I have documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
